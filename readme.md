# Mini project | E-commerce website | 2023 | GAMA | CEC


Abstract
------------------

The term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service. We aim to develop an e-commerce website of the sort but which is mainly centered around college students and their academics. Our "E-commerce Website for College Students" is an online platform that facilitates the buying and selling of second-hand textbooks and lecture notes among college students. The website provides an efficient and user-friendly marketplace where students can list their used academic materials for sale and browse through available items to purchase at discounted prices.



 
Technology Stack
------------------

The technology stack for the e-commerce platform will consist of various tools, frameworks, and libraries that contribute to its development, user experience, and security. Given below is a more detailed breakdown of the technology stack:
Frontend:
**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** / **EJS**:  HTML is the backbone of any web page. It defines the structure and content of the website, using various tags to represent headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. HTML ensures that the content is displayed correctly on different browsers and devices. Here we implement HTML pages as EJS for dynamic implementation and ease of use.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: CSS is used to control the visual appearance and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply styles such as fonts, colours, spacing, and positioning to make the website visually appealing and consistent across different pages.

**JavaScript**: JavaScript is a powerful programming language that runs on the client-side, enabling interactivity and dynamic content on web pages. With JavaScript, developers can handle user events, create animations, make AJAX requests, and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model).

**Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed UI components, responsive grid system, and CSS styles. It streamlines the frontend development process by offering ready-to-use components and ensuring a consistent and mobile-friendly user interface.
Backend:
**Node.js**: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the web browser. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests and building real-time applications.

**Express.js**: Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of APIs and web applications by providing essential features such as routing, middleware support, and request/response handling.

**CSRF Token**: A CSRF token is a security measure used to protect web applications from Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. It is a unique token generated by the server and included in each form or request sent to the application. When a user interacts with the application, the CSRF token is validated by the server to ensure the request comes from an authenticated source within the same application. By requiring this token, web applications can prevent attackers from executing unauthorized actions on behalf of users, enhancing overall security and protecting sensitive data.

Database: 
**MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format known as BSON (Binary JSON). It is well-suited for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it ideal for the dynamic nature of e-commerce platforms. MongoDB's document-based structure allows for easy scalability and data manipulation.

Payment Gateway Integration:
**Stripe**: Stripe is a popular payment gateway that allows businesses to accept online payments securely. It handles payment processing, ensuring smooth and reliable transactions for users. Integrating Stripe into the platform enables users to make payments using credit/debit cards with confidence.
By leveraging this comprehensive technology stack, the e-commerce platform for second-hand textbooks and lecture notes will have a well-structured frontend, scalable backend, secure payment processing, and reliable cloud hosting, resulting in a robust, user-friendly, and efficient web application.



Implementation
------------------

Modules:
**1.	User Module**:
•	User Registration:
o	Create an HTML form with fields for email, password, name, and other address and contact information.
o	Use Express.js and MongoDB to handle form submission and save user data securely in the database.
o	CSRF Token is implemented for password encryption.
•	User Login:
o	Implement a login form with email and password fields.
o	Use sessions for user authentication.
o	Compare the provided credentials with the data stored in MongoDB to validate the login.
•	User Authentication:
o	Use session-based authentication to restrict access to certain routes and actions on the website.
o	Implement middleware in Express.js to verify the authentication token on each request.

**2.	Products Module**:
•	Product Listing:
o	Create a form for users to add their second-hand textbooks and lecture notes to the website.
o	Use Express.js and MongoDB to save the product details in the database.
o	Allow users to upload an image for the product and store the image path in the database.
•	Product Search:
o	Implement a search bar on the homepage that allows users to search for products based on title.
o	Use MongoDB queries to retrieve relevant products based on the search query.
•	Product Details:
o	Create a product details page to display all the information about a specific product.
o	Fetch the product details from MongoDB and display them using EJS templates.

**3.	Cart Module**:
•	Add to Cart:
o	Implement a button or link on the product details page to add the product to the user's cart.
o	Use sessions or MongoDB to store the cart information for each user.
•	View Cart:
o	Create a cart page where users can view the items they have added to their cart.
o	Fetch cart information from sessions or MongoDB and display it using EJS templates.
•	Cart Persistence:
o	Ensure that the user's cart data is stored and retrieved correctly using sessions or MongoDB.
o	Handle cases where users log in from different devices or sessions expire.
•	Cart Checkout:
o	Provide a checkout button on the cart page that leads users to a secure payment gateway for payment processing.

**4.	Orders Module**:
•	Order Placement:
o	Create an order object in MongoDB when a user successfully completes the checkout process.
o	Include details such as products, quantities, total price, user information, and order status.
•	Order History:
o	Create a page where users can view their order history and the status of each order they've placed.
o	Fetch order details from MongoDB and display them using EJS templates.
•	Order Status:
o	Implement order tracking functionality to allow users to track the status of their ongoing orders.
o	Update the order status in the database as the order progresses (e.g., pending, fulfilled, cancelled).
